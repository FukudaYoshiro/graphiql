# Google Summer of Code Initiatives

We've applied for some [google summer of code initiatves](https://github.com/graphql/foundation/tree/master/mentorship/2020/gsoc), and are really excited about all the early interest!

Here's some information about some initiatives that are relevant to this repository:

## Initiative 2) Plugins
> **[original proposal](https://github.com/graphql/foundation/tree/master/mentorship/2020/gsoc#3-graphiql-plugins-medium)**

The plugin API for GraphiQL is currently in development.
We currently have both visual and plugin design proposals in the works:

- https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/issues/829
- https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/issues/978

and are developing a storybook of components for folks to use when creating plugins.

we anticipate that within 1-2 months, people will be able to begin developing plugins as described in the proposal.

most of the current work in progress can be described here:

- GraphiQL React 16 Migration + Context - https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/projects/4
- Implement Redesign, Layout & Themeing System -  https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/projects/11
- renderGraphiQL function and middlewares - https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/projects/8

and more projects towards plugin API will be created once these are closed.
